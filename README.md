A short description of the project.


## Running locally

To run a development instance locally, create a virtualenv, install the 
requirements from `requirements.txt` and launch `app.py` using the 
Python executable from the virtualenv.

## Deploying on ECS

Use `make image` to create a Docker image. Then, follow [these 
instructions](https://www.chrisvoncsefalvay.com/2019/08/28/deploying-dash-on-amazon-ecs/) 
to deploy the image on ECS.


## TODO
- 2 Violin Plots, 
- 1 Confusion Matrix, 
- 3 Graphs with DET curves, 
- 2 graphs with SDM curves, 
- potentially 1 line or a bar graph, and 
- 1 pivot table that summarizes a lot of the data
